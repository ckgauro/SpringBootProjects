### Step 41. Step-00: Create git branch for Validations & Global Exception Handling.md
Welcome back. It looks like we're going to create a good punch for validation and global exception handler. OK, so now we have completed close to four sections and in all the sections we are starting, step is to create a good brand, either with idea or either with the command line. So we'll see the step once and then as already, we have done it multiple times. This time we'll just go through the step what we are going to do and then we'll move on. OK, so first we verify that we are in good status to ensure that we are in the master masterbrand and then you can to get your code hyphen to create a new blood zero violations, global exceptional handler. And then we'll create. GitHub branch, using the get get push hyphenation, set up a origin and then in origin at this point of origin is nothing but the remote. And then what if I ever see a man ever get up? That's all. OK, so we're going we already implemented these steps, so we'll go to right. And then verify the same. We can see here through for validation. We will exceptionalities created OK. And same is also created in the remote branch too. So this completes the creation of GitHub step. . Just to save time or instead of having that as a repetitive step. So I just ensure that I have explained the steps here and then already exhibiter those things and then put that ready. So I'll see you in the next lecture and bye bye. Thank you.
