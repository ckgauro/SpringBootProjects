Welcome back. In this section, we are going to understand and implement exception, handling and response status escorts for a regular restful APIs. So we are going to look primarily into the response to Exception class, which is recently introduced in spring fire. So it is a fast rule for basic headed handling implementations in other restaurant space. So it's also an alternative approach, response to sanitation. And it is the best class for exceptions used for airplane status quo. Hester WTOP response so we can create an instance of it providing an A.P. status and optionally Alesund in the cars. So if you see in detail, it's a runtime exception and response status exception. Constructor arguments include social status, reason and cause. So in status and as GTP status, it has to be a response for that respectless. Philippe requests. And the reason? A message explaining the expection exception is that that particular response example, like if you have said the photo for as a response user, not form, there are a specific product, not from letter exactly in that manner, and also a triple call that the response to status description would cause. So if you see the benefits we get using response status exception classes, we can implement it quite fast. And there is no specific need for creating custom exception classes unless we have a need, because we can define hashtag response, status quo and better message at a time. As well, creating exceptions programmatically would have more control over exception handling, so at the same time, we have the benefit equal and we also have a little bit of downside. So if you see the downside, so we need to deal with the application as we're defining them programmatically, we find ourselves replicating multiple controllers. So I think thing is a global exception, handling this approach will not look like a global approach, like how we use in controller advice using controller advice, annotation. It is difficult to enforce application rate conventions using a single class here. And by combining both approaches, we can implement the control globally and also share those exceptions locally as required. And using that, we can achieve better results. Only thing we need to ensure is that we are not mixing up of handling exceptions in both ways. So we are trying we should ensure that we isolated everything properly when we are both in place. So that's more important. So now what about our implementation steps, how we are going to implement all these things? OK, so we see the very high level implementation steps and when we are implementing step by step, each step will have its own of details. OK. So as a first step, we are going to create a good Bransford exception handling. So this good plant will be created both locally and then also in the remote repositories so that all the exception handling this will implement in this respect to the plant. So next thing is we are going to implement a response to this exception. Forget usability service and the same way we are also going to implement response status exception for update user bayati service. So forget usability, whatever. We implement firmware update usability and so it will be the same. So or if required, we can even take it as an assignment so and instead that we are going to implement response status exception for the user usability service Dirichlet service level so far and step one and two, we will implement it at the controller layer and in step three we are going to implement that service layer. So when we are implementing that service layer, it is like directly we are using the response status exception but in step one into when we are implementing it, it IT controller will use that as a status exception and add the service layer within user customer exception and then move through that and then we'll catch it in the. Control earlier, so we'll see that how we're going to implement it, and in step four, we're going to implement this status exception for clear user service. And finally, once that is done, we are going to implement history status. Good 01 created response for creating user service in the same way and location header with user password cleared user service. So these are the five steps which we are going to implement as part of this exception handling. And this is the type of response status quo to section. Thank you.
